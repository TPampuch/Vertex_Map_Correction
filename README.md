# Vertex_Map_Correction

## Why?
This R-package was created to create reliable maps based on the pairwise distance measurements, created with the Vertex Laser Geo 360 (Hagl√∂f, Sweden) "compass" function. 
The Vertex provides the option to save GPS-coordinates, but in remote areas the distortion and thus the offset between coordinates can be very high. 
The solution is to measure "reference-trees" from more than one position (base) and use them to calculate and remove the offset. Manually, this can be 
a tiresome task, so here is an automated solution. 

## What?
The main function `VMC::VMC` needs the output of the Vertex Laser Geo 360 and the information on "base" (the position from which the tree was measured; 
which should be integers) and a column with the tree ID to find the overlapping trees.
