\description{
This function tries to minimize the offset introduced when mapping an area using a vertex laser geo 360.
The function checks for reference trees that where measured from several positions (bases) and simply
loops through base-pairs with overlapping information. The offset is reduced by moving all data-points
measured from one base towards the other base. Since the data cannot fit perfectly it repeats the step with
different base-pairs only as long as the sum of the squares of all offsets is further reduced.
